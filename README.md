#MazeSolver

This project will allow you to upload a picture of a maze to the tool then solve it using the tool

1:First open the application and load a image using the load button at the bottom of the app

2:Next click on a wall to set the wall color then select a corridor to set the corridor 

Sadly this project will not work with multicolored rainbow mazes however it will work with pictures taken by camera of a maze as it will guess if a pixel is a wall or corridor based on how close to the set color it is

3:Click on the start position and then the ending position of the maze.

4:Now your ready to go click solve at the top of the app and wait while the magic happens if everything went right( which it might not have) the maze should now be solved and you can save it using the save button at the top of the screen
